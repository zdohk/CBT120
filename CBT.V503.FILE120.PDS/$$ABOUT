MVS Tools and Tricks of the Trade

     The focus of this column is to provide MVS practitioners with
useful tools and ideas, to expand their horizons within this trade.
The column emphasizes "a different view" of MVS System Programming.
Often, "IBM says you can't" do something, and you really can, using
available tools, which are often free for the downloading and
installation.  Each month's column provides information that is
useful to both newbies and very experienced hands with decades of
experience.  Of course, everyone in-between is also included.
