//***FILE 120 is from Sam Golob and contains his columns from       *   FILE 120
//*           "Technical Support" magazine entitled "MVS Tools      *   FILE 120
//*           and Tricks of the Trade".  There are now over 19      *   FILE 120
//*           years' worth of articles, which are included here     *   FILE 120
//*           by consent from the publisher of the mazagine.        *   FILE 120
//*           (For Sam's old articles, see File 014.)               *   FILE 120
//*                                                                 *   FILE 120

//*           This file also contains articles written for the      *   FILE 120
//*           public that DO NOT belong to NaSPA and were never     *   FILE 120
//*           published by NaSPA.  These articles are members       *   FILE 120
//*           with prefixes of BM****** and you are welcome to      *   FILE 120
//*           read them.                                            *   FILE 120
//*                                                                 *   FILE 120
//*           This file contains the original versions of Sam's     *   FILE 120
//*           columns before they were edited, or shortened by      *   FILE 120
//*           the magazine because of space limitations.            *   FILE 120
//*                                                                 *   FILE 120
//*           At the time many of these articles were written,      *   FILE 120
//*           you needed to purchase a CBT Tape from NaSPA in       *   FILE 120
//*           order to obtain these materials.  Now, please just    *   FILE 120
//*           go to www.cbttape.org and download the files that     *   FILE 120
//*           you want, completely free of charge.  Try going       *   FILE 120
//*           to the "Updates Page" of www.cbttape.org first, to    *   FILE 120
//*           get the latest versions of the files, if they had     *   FILE 120
//*           been recently updated.                                *   FILE 120
//*                                                                 *   FILE 120
//*           It is perhaps convenient to include these articles    *   FILE 120
//*           on the CBT Tape itself, because many of them talk     *   FILE 120
//*           about how to make best use of software offerings      *   FILE 120
//*           which are distributed with this tape.                 *   FILE 120
//*                                                                 *   FILE 120
//*           After 19 plus years, NaSPA has (possibly temporarily) *   FILE 120
//*           stopped publishing "Technical Support" magazine.      *   FILE 120
//*           Meanwhile, I am writing some articles anyway, for the *   FILE 120
//*           betterment of the people (hopefully), and for myself. *   FILE 120
//*           Stuff that doesn't belong to NaSPA is prefixed by     *   FILE 120
//*           member name "BM".  Even though a copyright notice     *   FILE 120
//*           appears in these articles, I give my permission for   *   FILE 120
//*           people to copy them and spread them around.  It's     *   FILE 120
//*           only republication without permission, that I am      *   FILE 120
