The numbering scheme of the members of this file is very simple.

  All articles originally started with the letters:   CL
   (which stands for "column")

  The year of publication is:  89, 90, and the like.
  The sequence of publication is numeric, for sorting purposes,
   and then alphabetic, for easier identification.

  After the year 2000, the articles begin with CM, so they will sort
   later than the year 19nn articles.

  Thus, CL8901JA is from the January 1989 issue of "Technical Support".

  And, CM0001JA is from the January 2000 issue of "Technical Support".

  One article I wrote was rejected by the magazine, and it belongs
   to me.  It is included as member BM0009SE.  If you'll look in
   your September 2000 issue of Technical Support, I don't have a
   column there.  The reason was that (at the time), NaSPA was
   supporting other technical conferences besides SHARE, and they felt
   that if they published this article about SHARE, the other
   conferences would demand equal time.  (I respect their decision.)

  After this period, I wrote a few other articles that were not printed
   by "Technical Support" magazine.  These are copyrighted by me (feel
   free to use them), and the member names are also prefixed with "BM".

  ENJOY THEM ALL.....!!!!!!

  Hope this helps.
